<p>
It has been over 10 years. We are here thanks to the work of 131 developers. 49,124 commits
were made just to the ScummVM tree and those turned into a massive 1,085,714 lines of code
(excluding comments) and of course over 7.6 million downloads from the main site alone.
I would say those were a great ten years.
</p>

<p>
The outcome is ScummVM 1.4.0 which we are releasing today, 11/11/11 11:11:11.11.
</p>

<p>More games are supported: <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i> <small>(based
on the same engine as Kyrandia)</small>, the kids' game <i>Blue's Birthday Adventure</i>,
and the science fiction game <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i>. On top of that, practically all
supported Sierra SCI games now have their Amiga versions working. Our musically inclined
users will notice PC speaker support in <i>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</i> and
<i>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</i>, CMS support in <i>Loom</i>, <i>The Secret of
Monkey Island</i> and <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, fixed MIDI in the DOS versions
of the Elvira series, and even sound in <i>Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood</i>!
</p>

<p>As always, there are many more new features; you can find the full list in
