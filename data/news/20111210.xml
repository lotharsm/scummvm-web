<p>Take a little break and compose yourself. After tireless weeks of work, 
the ScummVM team is proud to announce support for two children's adventure games &mdash; 
<i>Gregory and the Hot Air Balloon</i> and <i>Darby the Dragon</i> &mdash; And on top of that, 
you can also play some interactive books from the <i>Magic Tales</i> series. So, if you can find 
your childhood spirit, dig out your copies and enjoy those adorable games.
</p>

<p>To play these, you'll need a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> 
of ScummVM. Any lurking bugs you find should be reported using our 
<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">bug tracker</a>, and 
along the way, please consider making few screenshots, following our
<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">guidelines</a>. 
</p>

<p>We are also looking for additional information on localised versions and <i>Magic Tales</i> books.
If you have one which is not recognized by the latest ScummVM daily build, please follow the guidelines 
<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Reporting_unknown_MD5_checksums">here</a> and report this 
to the team or as a bug.
</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
