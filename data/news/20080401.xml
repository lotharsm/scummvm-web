		...and the finger points to you! Or to be precise to Zanthia, youngest of the Kyrandian Mystics. But since she is the one you play in ScummVM's newest supported adventure <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia:_Book_Two:_Hand_of_Fate">
		<i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i></a> that is not a big difference. So grab your copy of <i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i> and a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> of ScummVM to help her save Kyrandia.

		Since we are not finished with supporting every feature, there are still some missing:
		Currently we support only the DOS CD-ROM version. Another thing missing is support for the in-game GUI, so saving is possible only via hotkeys. Check out the hotkey section of our <a href="http://scummvm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/README?view=markup">README</a> on how to do it.
		And last but not least we do not support MIDI output, so make sure you use AdLib as "Music Driver".

		Of course all bugs should be reported to <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our bug tracker</a>.
		Make sure you got all required <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Legend_of_Kyrandia.2C_The:_Hand_of_Fate">datafiles</a> before you report a bug though.
