<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Nippon_Safes%2C_Inc."><i>Nippon Safes, Inc.</i></a>, the first exciting instalment of the Parallaction engine, is now supported in current SVN builds (which can be found under "SVN Builds" on the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php">downloads page</a>) and open for testing and bug reporting via the <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">ScummVM bug tracker.</a>
</p>
<p>
Are you smarter than an experienced safe cracker?<br>

Are you dumber than a punch-drunk Italian former boxer?<br>

<i>*You might think you owe something even if you were parolled, but that's restricted to the slight case you <b>really</b> are a punch-drunk boxer.
