<p>We are pleased to announce the 0.9.1 ScummVM bugfix release.
</p>

<p>There were lots of important bugfixes and small improvements. We are also
glad that three additional platforms are now officially supported: Nintendo DS,
GP2X and GP32. You can already download official DS and GP2X binaries, and
the GP32 port will be available soon.
</p>

<p>Some of the most significant bugfixes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many fixes for Humongous Entertainment games and better support for
international versions of the games</li>
<li>Improved detection of the FM-TOWNS version of Indy3</li>
<li>Several fixes for The Feeble Files and more non-English versions are supported now</li>
<li>Some parts of the Kyrandia engine were rewritten so the game needs less CPU power now,
and thus works better on lower-end devices</li>
<li>The PSP, PS2 and WinCE ports were greatly improved</li>
<li>The PalmOS port is again up-to-date and features separate build for Tapwave Zodiac</li>
<li>The WinCE port supports 2002 devices again</li>
</ul>
