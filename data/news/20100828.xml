You're Doralice, the cutest airline captain of the Paris-Miami flight. During your last trip, a dying passenger asked you to deliver top secret vials. Will you succeed in your mission, avoiding deadly traps and solving every mystery?

<p>
Currently, the PC versions of <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/fascination">Fascination</a> are missing an AdLib player, but everything else is there.
Please note that the CD version requires some manipulations and the ScummVM tools to extract the <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Fascination">required files</a>.
</p>

<p>
Get the latest <a href="http://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily">daily build of ScummVM</a> and your version of the game and give Fascination a try!
