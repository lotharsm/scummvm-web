<p>It's time for everyone's favorite semiannual event! ScummVM Release Testing Season (TM)! However, this season we will be testing for <b>1.0.0</b>! That's right, <b>1.0.0</b>!
</p>
<p>For this release, we have added support for a bunch of new games: <i>Cruise for a Corpse</i>, <i>Discworld</i>, <i>Discworld 2 - Missing Presumed ...!?</i>, <i>Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2</i>, <i>The Manhole</i>, <i>Return to Zork</i>, and <i>Rodney's Funscreen</i>.
</p>
<p>As usual, go grab a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> of ScummVM, play through the games and submit any bugs you see along the way to the <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">bug tracker</a>. When you complete a game, report it on the <a href="http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=7599">forums</a> so we can add it to our <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.0.0">release testing wiki page</a>. Be sure to provide the version, language, and platform of the game you're testing (in addition to the name of course). You can find more details on testing <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing">over here</a>.
