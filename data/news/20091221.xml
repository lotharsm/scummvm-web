The year is 1995.  The place is the Czech Republic.  You find yourself
surrounded by inventive minds producing the latest Czech point-and-click
adventure, and historically the first Czech CD-ROM-based adventure game.  You
are Bert, a young dragon with a taste for adventure.  After being corrupted by
an evil magic wand named Eveline, you are desperate to remedy the mischiefs you
created.  You decide to set out to find your father who disappeared a while
ago.
