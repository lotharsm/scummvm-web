<p>
Did you hear about our plans for 1.0.0? This is going to be the best ScummVM release ever! And to make it even more remarkable, we have decided to put out a Release Candidate, which is <a href="/downloads.php">awaiting you here</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is a regular stable and supported release so don't let the name of 'Release Candidate' or 'RC1' throw you off. We have a
<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.0.0">release
testing wiki page</a> for the upcoming 1.0.0 release, which we would like to
see turned into a mass of green indicating successful removal of any issues in
the titles supported, and thus we need your help, our dear users of ScummVM. It
would be really great to test as many games as possible on all varieties of
platforms our project is ported to.
</p>
