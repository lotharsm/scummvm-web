<p>Only four weeks since our last release and already ScummVM 1.1.1
is available on our
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>This release concentrates primarily on fixing bugs, bugs, and even more bugs.
As such, we strongly recommend all and every ScummVM user to update
to this latest and greatest version. In particular, just as promised
we fixed the issues affecting <em>Nippon
Safes Inc</em> and <em>Pajama Sam 1</em> in 1.1.0. </p>
