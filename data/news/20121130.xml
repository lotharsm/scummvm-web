		The city of Waterdeep is in dire need of heroes to defend it from the
		evil below the city. Assemble a group of four heroes, heed the call
		of the Lords of Waterdeep and start your quest in the sewers below the
		city!
	</p>
	<p>
		But beware, for this is not your only quest. Archmage Khelben needs you
		to investigate strange happenings near the Temple of Darkmoon. People
		around it are disappearing and human remains are found in shallow
		graves.
