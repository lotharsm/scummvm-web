<p>
ScummVM continues to leap forward in a leap year, and we are pleased
to announce the next shiny bugfix release of the project.
</p>
<p>
As usual, it holds a number of improvements, it's more stable, and it
should bring you even more fun than 0.11.0.
</p>
<p>
We fixed the digital iMUSE system (better <i>COMI</i> experience), <i>King's
Quest 4</i> bugs were squashed, and support for
fanmade AGI games has been improved; <i>Lure of
the Temptress</i>, <i>Inherit the Earth</i> and <i>I Have no Mouth</i> all
work better since we fixed several crashes, lock-ups and all such buzzwords.
</p>
<p>
As a special bonus we are glad to announce the return of the <b>BeOS</b> port and the
deeply missed <b>Playstation 2</b> port.
</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive list of improvements you are welcome to visit
