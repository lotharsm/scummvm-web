		Lord Horrible has sent you on a quest to kill the Queen of Everything,
		playing the role of the horribly disfigured Phlegmwad you will have the
		chance to choose how to (not?) fullfill this quest of epic proportions.

	<p>
		With great help from game developer Deirdra Kiai and Wintermute developer Jan Nedoma
		the ScummVM Team is pleased to announce support for our first Wintermute game:
		<a href="http://www.deirdrakiai.com/my-games/"><i>Chivalry is Not Dead</i></a>.
		So, download a copy of the game and start playing
		in the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily">latest daily build</a>
		of ScummVM and help us with testing this open-ended game.
	</p>
	<p>
		How many endings can YOU find?
