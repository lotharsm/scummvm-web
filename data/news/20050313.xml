We now have an extensive list of boot params for Fate of Atlantis on our
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=bootparam">boot params page</a>. Many
thanks to Laura Abbott who spent a lot of time to compose this list and
then generously donated it to us. I am sure this will help us working on
FOA issues in the future.

In other news, Robert Kelsen has volunteered to work as a SlackWare
packager, and has started by providing a
<a href="http://scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/0.7.0/scummvm-0.7.0-slack-i486-1.tgz">SlackWare binary of 0.7.0</a>.
Way to go, Rob!

So, apparently, some people actually read our news section... I am
astonished ;-). Thanks to all of you out there who contribute to ScummVM
by providing us with useful feedback, and the occasional praise -- both
really help keeping up interest in working on ScummVM!
