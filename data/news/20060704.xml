<p>As many users of the Windows CE port have noticed, the 0.9.0 release
has some sound and music related issues which usually ended with a crash.
The obscure bugs were hunted down and corrected.
We urge all PocketPC and Smartphone users to download the updated 0.9.0a
build from our
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php">downloads page</a>
or our <a href="http://scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/0.9.0/">SourceForge</a> files section.
It may be a while until all mirrors pick up the file, so be patient.
