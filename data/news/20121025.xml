<p>The ScummVM team, in close collaboration with Nayma soft (the legal rights owner) and DotEmu, is happy to announce support for <i>Tony Tough</i> in our development branch. The title is available for purchase from <a href="http://www.dotemu.com/affiliate/32202/node/4600">DotEmu</a>.</p>
 
<p>However, the game was tested only on Windows and Linux, so we would like to announce our usual testing period. Please grab the game from your attic or <a href="http://www.dotemu.com/affiliate/32202/node/4600">purchase it</a> from DotEmu, test it with a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> and submit your bug reports to <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our bug tracker</a>.</p>
 
<p>We would also like to take this opportunity to announce the affiliation program with DotEmu: By buying games through <a href="http://www.dotemu.com/affiliate/32202">this link</a> or by using the banner on the right side of the page, you will be supporting ScummVM.</p>
