<p>The Neverhood needs you! Klaymen, our hero, wakes up in a building in the strangely
empty world of Neverhood. It's up to you to explore and find out what happened to
Neverhood's wacky clay world.</p>

<p>The ScummVM Team is proud to announce that
<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/neverhood">The Neverhood</a>
is now playable in ScummVM using the latest
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily builds</a>, and ready for
testing. As usual, all bugs should be reported to
<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our bug tracker</a> following our
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a>.
While you play through the game, we would also love it if you could take some
