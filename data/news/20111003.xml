<p>Fasten your seatbelts because another ScummVM release is just around the corner!</p>

<p>However, we need <i>your</i> help first in testing out a few games before we can release. In addition to the two new games for this release, <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i> and <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i>, we have a few other games that need testing. Please take a look at <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.4.0">our wiki page</a> to see which games need a playthrough.</p>

<p>As with all release testing, you'll need a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> to get started. If you happen to find any bugs, please report them on the <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">bug tracker</a>. Once you complete one of the games, please let us know on <a href="http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10901">the forums</a> so we can throw the results up on the <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.4.0">wiki page</a>. Further information can be found in the <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing">release testing guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>And Strangerke would like to remind you to grab a couple of screenshots of <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i> and <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i> for us and submit them according to our <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">guidelines</a>.</p>
