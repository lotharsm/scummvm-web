Whilst we know that the end of the year is approaching, it saddens us to announce that
the ScummVM project is closing due to personal reasons on behalf of most of the developers.
Visitors to our forum, such as timofonic, have suspected this may be the case for some time
and unfortunately I have been urged by einheitlix to tell the truth.
</p>
<p>
It's been a great ride, and we had some really wonderful things in store for you, such as a
new game we were planning to freeware for our next release, and the announcement that the
oft-requested completion of support for Full Throttle was underway - although it would
probably be in 0.7.0 not 0.6.0... but it's moot now.
</p>
<p>I was planning on holding back this news until after the festivities, but as it's just a
hoax to see how many people actually read our news page and pay attention, I've decided to
announce it now.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>In summary, in case people just skimmed that last paragraph: we are NOT really dead.
We're very much alive and kicking, and will be bringing you lots-o-cool-stuff early next
year!</strong></em>
