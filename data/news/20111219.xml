No, not that force, it's Blue Force. Jake Ryan has just graduated from the
Policy Academy, and it's up to you to guide his actions as he starts his police
career. He'll quickly become involved in solving a series of crimes which,
unbeknownst to him, are inextricably entwined with the murder of his parents
when he was a child.
