<p>"They said it would it would never be done. They were wrong." After a slight hiatus
at the start of the year, work has finally finished on our next TsAGE game, Return to
Ringworld. The only remaining work still in progress is a card game available on the
in-game consoles, and is completely unrelated to the main story.</p>

<p>This is a direct sequel to the original Ringworld game.. after saving the puppeteer
race from extermination and uncovering some powerful ancient technology on the first
game, Quinn, Seeker of Vengeance and Miranda Rees find themselves searched for as
fugitives by all three major species, so they plan to go to Ringworld to hide. But it
turns that their ship has suffered problems. And fixing them and getting to Ringworld
will only be the start of their problems..</p>
