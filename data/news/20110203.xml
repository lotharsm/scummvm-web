Did you ever want to experience the world of the Toons, like in the movies "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" or "Space Jam"? Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonstruck">Toonstruck</a>, the zany newly supported game that casts Christopher Lloyd (Great Scott!) as Drew Blanc, a cartoon animator who lands in a place where anything is possible. With his sidekick Flux Wildly, help him to solve the tons of puzzles in order to get back home to the real world!
