Chief finally found a husband for his "beautiful" daughter, but before the end of the ceremony, Leon escaped. So now... where is Leon?

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce that <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/sotys">Soltys</a> is playable for the first time in English and Polish using ScummVM! Special thanks to L.K. Avalon and Mr Wi&#347;niewski for providing the sources and to nutron for spending so much time on the translation!
</p>
<p>
You'll need a daily build to get started, then grab the game on our <a href="http://scummvm.org/downloads/#extras">downloads page</a> and test it! As usual, all bugs should be reported to <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our bug tracker</a> following our <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a>. While you play through the game, we would love it if you could take some <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">screenshots</a> for us.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to contribute further, you could invest some of your free time in translating Soltys and Dragon History, which should be easy to translate to most European-based languages. If you are interested, please contact <a href="mailto:translation AT scummvm DOT org">translation AT scummvm DOT org</a>.
