		You are Jerome Lange, a Bogart clone private eye who's received an invitation from an old friend 
		to join her at Mortville Manor to help with a desperate situation. With a name like Mortville you
		might suppose something is seriously wrong and, yes, you're right. Your old friend Julia has already 
		departed to Deadsville.

		So... Who did dunnit?
