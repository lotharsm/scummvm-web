<p>As some of you may already be aware of, the engines of <i>Gobliins 2</i> and <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/The_Prophecy"><i>Ween: The Prophecy</i></a> share a lot of code. The differences have now been taken care of and we therefore add it to the list of our supported games. As always, we'd like you, our users, to report any still existing bugs.</p>

<p>You know the procedure: Grab your copy of <i>Ween: The Prophecy</i> and a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> of ScummVM, read the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a>, find the bugs and place them in the REVUSS (<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our bug tracker</a>).</p>

<p>...and thus will the bugs be wiped out...</p>
