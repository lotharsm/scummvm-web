ScummVM takes you on an adventure in the world of Zork, with support for two
new games! In Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands, your task is to embark on a
journey to solve the mystery of a spirit called Nemesis, and of the four
alchemists it killed. On your second journey to Zork, in Zork: Grand
Inquisitor, you must find three legendary objects that will restore all magic
to the realm and bring about the fall of Grand Inquisitor Yannick, whose goal
is to "shun magic, shun the appearance of magic, shun everything, and then shun
shunning".
