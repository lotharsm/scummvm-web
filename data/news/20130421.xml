Greetings, fellow adventure gamers! We have finally come to the point when ScummVM 1.6.0 testing starts.
</p>
 
<p>
This release adds support for a number of new games that need to be tested:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><i>3 Skulls of the Toltecs</i></li>
<li><i>Eye of the Beholder</i></li>
<li><i>Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon</i></li>
<li><i>Hopkins FBI</i></li>
<li><i>Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</i></li>
<li><i>The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime</i></li>
</ul>
 
<p>
In addition, if you have Macintosh version of <i>Discworld</i>, please give it a try as well.
</p>
 
<p>
A <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> should be used for testing these, 
and if something goes unexpectedly wrong, please report it to our 
<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">bug tracker</a>. 
The completed games need to be reported on <a href="http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=12392">our
forums</a> and we will update our <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.6.0">release
testing page</a>. For a usable test report, we need you to provide the version, language, and platform
of the game you're testing. And, of course, please stick to the 
<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing">testing guidelines</a>.
</p>
 
<p>
This release also has another interesting aspect. Depending on how intensively games are tested, 
we will add support for one more game: <i>Hopkins FBI</i>. For support to happen, we need test 
results on several platforms using several variants of the game, which includes the BeOS, OS/2, 
Linux and Windows versions.
</p>
 
<p>
In conclusion, if you want <i>Hopkins FBI</i> in ScummVM 1.6.0, grab your originals and contribute 
to this new testing period! We are also in need of screenshots too! Please submit them to 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&amp;atid=418822">our patch tracker</a>.
