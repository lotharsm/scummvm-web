<p>After 11 long months we are thrilled to announce the release of ScummVM
1.6.0.</p>

<p>It's not very often (if ever) that we add 4 new engines in a single release,
but yes, these have been busy months for the team indeed.</p>

<p>Let's just list the new games 1.6.0 contains for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>3 Skulls of the Toltecs</i></li>
  <li><i>Eye of the Beholder</i></li>
  <li><i>Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon</i></li>
  <li><i>Hopkins FBI</i></li>
  <li><i>Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</i></li>
  <li><i>The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Other significant features include support for the Macintosh version of
<i>Discworld 1</i> and the music in the Macintosh versions of LucasArts
adventures, an update to the latest Roland MT-32 emulation code, a new cool
grid chooser for your savegames, an extended FluidSynth configuration dialog,
and major bugfixes to bike fights in <i>Full Throttle</i>. We have also added
Belarusian, Finnish and Galician translations to our GUI.</p>

<p>Of course, there is much more; you can find the full list in <a
