<p>A year has passed and ScummVM 1.7.0 is here.</p>

<p>With this release we have added support for 5 completely new games. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>The Neverhood</i></li>
  <li><i>Mortville Manor</i></li>
  <li><i>Voyeur</i></li>
  <li><i>Return to Ringworld</i></li>
  <li><i>Chivalry is Not Dead</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, we have updated the MT-32 emulator, added an OpenGL backend, improved many aspects of the GUI,
	enhanced the AGOS engine, made <i>Urban Runner</i>'s videos
	less CPU-demanding, fixed tons of bugs in dozens of SCI games, improved
	sound in <i>Loom</i> and <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i> and
	improved platform portability for the Tony and Tinsel engines.</p>

<p>But this is not all. We have added experimental support for the OUYA console
	(we couldn't add GCW-Zero support simply because sev <i>still</i> awaits his
	console from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gcw/gcw-zero-open-source-gaming-handheld/posts">Kickstarter</a>), made major improvements to the PS2 port and merged
	the Bada with Tizen ports.</p>

<p>The full list with all changes mentioned can be found in <a

release notes</a> and the release can be obtained as usual from our <a

<p>Everybody Way Oh!</p>
