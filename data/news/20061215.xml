<p>It was a complete surprise to all of us, but our old-timer Gregory
Montoir aka <b>cyx</b> several weeks ago submitted a practically finished
engine. It is used by the game <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Touch%C3%A9:_The_Adventures_of_the_Fifth_Musketeer"><i>Touch&eacute;:
The Adventures of the Fifth Musketeer</i></a>.
Some more work has been performed, and now we are announcing full support
for this title.</p>

<p>For you, our fellow users, this means that we are starting a great bug-hunting
session. Grab your English, French, German or Italian, or even just the game
demo and start testing. Stick Geoffroi Le Brun's nose in every hole in the game
and report if it unexpectedly gets broken.</p>

<p>As usual, to play the game you will need a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily
build</a> of ScummVM. Bugs and graphical glitches should be submitted to
<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our
bug tracker</a>, and please, follow the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug
submission guidelines</a>. Also, if you encounter some yet unrecognized
version, report it to the same tracker.</p>

<p>Screenshots are required as well. Besides, we are still waiting for
<i>Future Wars</i> screenshots as nobody submitted any yet.
</p>

<p>We are sure that you will enjoy this yet another gem stone now supported by
ScummVM.</p>
