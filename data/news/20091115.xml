<p>It was just 3.5 months ago when we started to prepare for this release, and now finally the
day has come.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please greet the one and only ScummVM 1.0.0 "Shiny Logo!" The long
awaited, the most anticipated, the best... whatever.</p>

<p>We worked very hard on stability in this release, and in addition to all
that goodness available since our 1.0.0rc1, we added a new set of ports for Motorola Linux-based
phones (those on MotoEZX and MotoMAGX platforms) and fixed just a few hundred bugs.
</p>

<p>The release is available from the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/">usual place</a>,
and the full list of changes can be found <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/raw/v1.0.0/NEWS">right
here</a> in the NEWS file.
</p>

<p>
Now jump to the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>, grab a build for your favorite
device and spread the word that ScummVM is 1.0.0!
</p>
