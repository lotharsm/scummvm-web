<p>We're proud to announce that ScummVM support for The Legend of Kyrandia is now complete!
</p> <p>This means that we now need you, our users, to give us a helping hand.
In order to root out any remaining bugs, extensive testing is sorely needed.
So, please dig upyour (legal!) copies of Kyrandia 1, download a SVN snapshot of
ScummVM and the required Kyra data file from the <a
href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">Downloads</a> page, and post any bugs you find to our
<a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">Bug
tracker</a> :). Any other issues can be discussed in the <a
href="http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=8176">forum</a>. </p>
<p>Currently both CD and floppy editions are supported in their own language.
English, French, German and Spanish versions are fully supported, but any other
PC (and hopefully Mac) version should work as well (albeit with some text in
English, and some interface graphics missing). If you have an unsupported
version, we'd love to hear from you! Note that Amiga versions are unfortunately
not supported at all at this time. </p>
