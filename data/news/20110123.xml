New year, new supported games. And we are proud to announce two of such newly supported games right away!
</p>

<p>
The first one is the FMV-tastic detective mystery <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/urban-runner">Urban Runner</a>: You are the investigative reporter Max who's being hunted for a murder he didn't commit by both the police and the actual killers. Can you escape your hunters and solve the crime?
</p>

<p>
The second one is an obscure interactive storybook for children of the Playtoons series: <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Playtoons_Limited_Edition_-_Bambou_le_Sauveur_de_la_Jungle">Bambou le Sauveur de la Jungle</a>. We have only managed to find the French version of the game; other language versions may or may not exist. Information on these would be very much appreciated.
</p>

<p>
So, grab your running shoes and/or jungle hat, the latest <a href="http://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily">daily build of ScummVM</a>, your game CDs and join us in the (bug)hunt! The needed datafiles can be found <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Urban_Runner">here</a> and <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Playtoons:_Bambou_le_Sauveur_de_la_Jungle">here</a>. Bugs should be reported to our <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/"> bug tracker</a>, but please follow our <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a>. <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">Screenshots</a> of both games would be great too!
