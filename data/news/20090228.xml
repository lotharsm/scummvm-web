<p>As we turned to a 6 months release cycle, <a href="/downloads.php">here</a> is our newest and best ScummVM version for you!</p>

<p>
A couple of new engines were added, and besides 2 Humongous Entertainment titles, we now support <i>The 7th Guest</i> and <i>Bud Tucker in Double Trouble</i>.
</p>

<p>Among other notable things there is a completely new vector-based GUI, which is a merged work of our last year GSoC student Vicent Marti, as well as a General Main Menu which adds a common save/load interface to most of our engines, adding the much awaited Return to Launcher feature along the way. It was the work of another successful student, Chris Page.
</p>

<p>A complete list of new games and features can be found in the <a href="http://scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/0.13.0/ReleaseNotes">release notes</a>, and the latest ScummVM version itself (available for a large number of platforms as usual) is located at the <a href="/downloads.php">downloads page</a>.
</p>

<p>Let's play!</p>
