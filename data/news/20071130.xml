<p>ScummVM now adds another freeware title to its list of games: <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Lure_of_the_Temptress">
<i>Lure of the Temptress</i></a>,
which was the first game to use Revolution Software's Virtual Theatre engine. Players must help Diermot escape
imprisonment, unravel the mysteries surrounding the Skorl occupation of the town, and eventually defeat the evil
enchantress that controls them.
