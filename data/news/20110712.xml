<p>
We are proud to announce a maintenance release of the ScummVM 1.3.x series.
This release has a number of fixes, mainly related to audio. Also, several games
had slipped past testing for 1.3.0 and turned out to be no longer completable.
They have now been fixed, so if you want to play <i>Discworld</i>,
<i>Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb</i>, <i>I Have No Mouth, and I Must
Scream</i>, or play FM-TOWNS SCUMM games on mobile devices or consoles,
we highly recommend that you upgrade.
</p>

<p>The release can be found on our
<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads">downloads page</a>
and <a href="http://scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/1.3.1/ReleaseNotes">full 
release notes</a> are also available from our site.
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
