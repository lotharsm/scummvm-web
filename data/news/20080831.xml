		We can call it a tremendous development. Half a year since 0.11.1 passed pretty quickly, and we are pleased to announce the release of 0.12.0!
	</p>
	<p>
This new version of ScummVM adds support for 5 completely new games. The games that now run smoothly on many more platforms than was initially intended are: <i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i>, <i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Three: Malcolm's Revenge</i>, <i>Lost in Time</i>, <i>The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble</i> and <i>Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The number of supported platforms grew as well. The <b>PS2</b> port has been revived, and the <b>GameCube</b> and <b>Wii</b> are now supported too. Take your Wiimote and make your beloved adventure game protagonist run around the screen :).
