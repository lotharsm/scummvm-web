<p><a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Bargon_Attack"><i>Bargon Attack</i></a>, which like <i>Ween: The Prophecy</i> shares most of the code with <i>Gobliins 2</i>, is now completable and supported. Hence, we ask you to catch up with the Bargonians and hunt for bugs along the way.</p>

<p>The procedure is the same as the last few times: take your copy of Bargon Attack and a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> of ScummVM. Be sure you read the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a> and enter any bugs into <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">our bug tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Some screenshots would be nice, too.</p>

<p>Oh, and check out Ender's speech at LCA2007 <a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/tuesday/tuesday_1650_gaming.ogg">here</a>.</p>
