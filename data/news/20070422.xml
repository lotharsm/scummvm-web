<p>The blazingly fast addition of <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Goblins_3"><i>Goblins 3</i></a> was gracefully performed thanks to the not-so-big differences from <i>Gobliins 2</i>.</p>

<p>For you, an average peasa... adventurer, that means that <b>YOU</b> can reach an agreement between King Bodd and Queen Xina.</p>

<p>Will you succeed? Find out by grabbing your old copy of <i>Goblins 3</i> from your dusty shelves, combining it with a shiny new <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">ScummVM 0.10.0svn</a> (check the build date, it has to be after April 21, 2007, yes, 2007).</p>
