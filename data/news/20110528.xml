<p>
It has been longer than usual since the last release. Nevertheless the team is happy to announce the release of ScummVM 1.3.0.
</p>

<p>
The release is truly feature-rich: in particular we are introducing support for a new platform, WebOS, and adding a set of new games:
<i>Urban Runner</i>, <i>Playtoons</i>, <i>Toonstruck</i>, <i>Hugo</i> series, <i>Living Books</i>, <i>Backyard Baseball</i>.
We have also continued to work hard on the SCI engine, so Amiga and some Macintosh versions of the games are supported now too.
Many of our ports received improvements, and a number of bugs have been fixed in practically every engine. Thus your gameplay should
be smoother and more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>As usual, the release can be found on our <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads">downloads page</a>
and <a href="http://scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/1.3.0/ReleaseNotes">full release notes</a> are also available.
